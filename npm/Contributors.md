I made table-sort-js for my own use case when I needed to sort a table.

Objectives of table-sort-js:
* Be easy to use (e.g Download one file and just put "table-sort" on table tags to make sortable).
* No dependencies (No jQuery)
* Be able to sort (dates, numbers, alpha,alphanumeric, etc.)(Properly; meaning natural sort)
* Not interfere too much with the css of tables that should be left to the user.

You are welcome to open issues or make pull requests.

This project is a react app which can be run by npm install and then npm start.

Pull requests can be made on the file table-sort-js/public/table-sort.js
This file is published to https://leewannacott.github.io/table-sort-js/table-sort.js

You can modify testTable.js in table-sort-js/src/testTable.js for the feature or
bug request you are testing. You can go to http://localhost:3000/ if you have used npm start. 

Alternatively download table-sort.js and use your
own HTML page and table to test by using <script src="table-sort-js"></script>

Example: https://www.cssscript.com/minimal-table-sorter/

If table-sort-js actually gets used by people then I might set up a testing framework.
